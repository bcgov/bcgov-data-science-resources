# What is Python?

Python is a scripting language.  It can be used to write very simple scripts or automations as well as highly complex applications.   Some examples include:
- Youtube
- Reddit
- Instagram
- Pinterest

Lots more info exists out there on what exactly python is:
- [python.org definition](https://www.python.org/doc/essays/blurb/)

# Why Python?

There are lots of reasons for choosing python. My top __ list include:
- its a simple language that is easy to learn.
- Includes a large number of libraries/modules to help with what it is you are trying to build.
- Related to libraries, there is a ton of things you can do with python, including:
   - can read / write / analyze data from databases, spreadsheets, rest api's, and spatial formats.
   - web programming
   - data science / data analysis
   - spatial data manipulation and analysis
   - 
- Its a stepping stone into programming.  While it supports more complex programming concepts, understanding of them is not required to get started.
- Building tools / applications in python is much less cumbersome then many other languages and can cut development time significantly.  Especially for new programmers.


# A Few Resources for Getting Started

A great place to start is this list of resources compiled at [python.org](https://wiki.python.org/moin/BeginnersGuide/Programmers)

The two resources that I have found the most useful for getting started are:
- [python.org tutorial](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/)
- [code academy python course](https://www.codecademy.com/catalog/language/python)

I also highly recommend creating a [stackoverflow account](https://stackoverflow.com/) if you haven't already done so.  When you get stuck I guarantee someone else has already experiences either your specific problem or something similar and had documented it there.  After creating your account you can also subscribe to the 'python' tag allow you to answer question other people have.
